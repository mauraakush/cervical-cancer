this program uses the cervical cancer dataset from the UCI Machine Learning repository.

- the data was reformatted and only one outcome variable (biopsy proven cervical cancer) was kept
- three machine learning models were run on the data to determine the best model for predicting cervical cancer
- the three models are logistic regression, artificial neural network, and ridge regression. variable importance 
was run on each model to show which variables contributed the most to each model. olden method was used for the 
artificial neural network model.
